Markdown xrc
====================

markdownxrc is a fork of [markdownsharp][] at version 1.13 (23/Sept/2012).
The goal of this fork is to just support virtual link (with tilde ~).
For example ~/test.html link inside a markdown file should produce 
/yourvirtualpath/test.html if your web site is on a virtual path or 
/test.html if your web site isn't on a virtual path.
